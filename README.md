#Data-Structures & Algorithms

##Approach
###Insertion Sort
The insertion sort is the most basic of the sort methods and there is plenty of documentation online about how to do one. My algorithm simply compares a number with the last in the array and swaps until the value is larger than the one it is compared to.

##Merge Sort
After some research online and watching a video on merge sort, I was able to grasp the sorting part pretty easily. It took me a little longer to understand the recursive merging part. The discussion in class was helpful for this.
